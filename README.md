cordova-ble-helloworld
======================

In 5 Steps
1- setup all the cordova stuff (including Xcode, certificates, Android SDK, ios-deploy and yada yada yada).
2- Make sure that internet is _turned_ on.
3- add your platform (cordova platform add ios).
4- run the stuff (cordova run ios -d ) with your phone connected via that cable you always seem to misplace.
5- There is no step 5 :S


Troubleshooting
===============
Make sure that there is no lldb and pythong process running for run ios

The console run for iOS always starts slower for me compared to using a prepared cordova project from Xcode (cordova prepare ios)
